## Backend Folder Information

Before running any scripts, please run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

This runs the server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Once the server is running, requests can be made from the frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Otherwise, you can use ARC or whichever API testing tool to access the various endpoints.

Additional information for this README coming soon...
